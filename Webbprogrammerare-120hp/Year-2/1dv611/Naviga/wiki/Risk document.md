## Hur hanterar vi olika ambitionsnivåer.
Vi är initialt ganska överens att ambtionsnivån gemensamt i gruppen är att samtliga ska kunna delta känns sig engagerade och att vi siktar på att bli godkända i kursen.
  
Vi ska göra vårat bästa att inte prokastrinera dokumenationen alla tillsammans. Vi förväntar oss att kunna ge feedback och ta feedback genom hela processen och försöka ta det som konstruktiv kritik.
