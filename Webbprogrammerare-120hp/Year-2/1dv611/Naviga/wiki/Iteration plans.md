### Analysis of last iteration ###
Last iteration was the starting iteration of the project which made it a research iteration where we started up with everything. We had a meeting with the customer where we got a basic understanding of the current system they are using and what they wanted us to do, this is explained in the requirements document. We started working on the documentation and research on the serverless architecture using amazon AWS. At the end of the iteration we received documents regard the clients demands and specifications for the system that we then have worked with to create a specification document with use cases and updated the risk document. This first iteration was good and everybody worked well. 

[Here is the time report for the first iteration.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Time%20Table)

### New risks
The first iteration came with a lot of risks since we didn't have any from before. All risks are listed 
[here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)
After our first meeting with the client we saw a lot of new risks and fears that the project and scope of project would be to big and hard to define. Later in the iteration we received a specification document that made the project easier to define and made some risks lower in grade as we felt that we understood the project better. 

### Iteration goals ###
Iteration 1 will focus on specifying the project, filling up the specification document with both basic specification and in depth specification. We are also going to do a lot of research regarding AWS, S3, uploading progress within a client and exif tool. We will start up a pipeline in bitbucket and set up our architecture (SAM) within AWS.

# Iteration 2 #

| Requirement | Task                  | State       | Estimated time |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| -           | Continue with creating a backlog together with the specification document | Done  | 6 h | 
| -           | Write our own uses cases and specification document | Not started / transferd from last iteration |  6h | 
| -           | Meeting with university supervisor    | Done     | 5 h  |
| -           | Continue with client  | Done  | 30 h |
| -           | Continue with lambda functions for getting url and S3 bucket handeling | Done  | 30 h |
| -           | Research and usage of exifTool | Done  | 20 h | 
| -           | Continue with the building process scripts and usage | Done  | 30 h |
| **Total actual time for iteration: 117 h** |

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 1 was the first real iteration of work. The iteration started with the creation of a basic build process using bitbucket pipeline. We started creating branches and getting familiar with how we should work on the project so that everybody in the group get a good understanding on what and how we should work. We spent a lot of time doing research and experimenting on mainly AWS lambda and S3 buckets, as well as on how the client should work and what needed to be done there. We also started working on getting to know a tool called exifTool which handles metadata which we are going to use in the project.  
We still have a lot of question marks regarding the tools and techniques which especially include AWS lambda which none of use have used before and therefore a lot of time were put into research and experimenting.

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)
As for new risks and new priorities we feel like not understanding all the new tools and techniques currently are the biggest risks since it currently feels like with every straightened question mark comes a new one. The group is working very well together and we feel like we have a good overview of what the project should include and what needs to be done, but how we actually do everything is what we fear is a big risk right now.   

### Iteration goals ###
Thumbnail, uploading process on client, hopefully some testing, understanding the AWS architecture and how everything is connected and how we need to build it.


# Iteration 3 #

All numbered requirement IDs are from the backlog document found [here](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Product%20Backlog).

| Requirement | Task                  | State       | Estimated time |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 4 documentation  | Continue with creating a backlog together with the specification document | Transferred from last iteration / Done | 6 h | 
| 4 documentation | Write our own uses cases and specification document | Done  |  6h |

| 2.2 state machine, 2 backend | Creating a state machine for AWS and creating of lambda functions to use in it | In-progress | 30 h | 
| **Total actual time for iteration: 117 h** |

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 2 was a great iteration for the group. Everybody worked really well and a lot of progress, especially on the backend was made. We all feel like we are starting to get a good feel for how AWS and lambda functions actaully work, and we have a couple of smaller functions made. The client has came a long way and it is possible to upload images from the client using a presigned url to an S3 bucket which was one of the basic features requested by the costumer. Exif data extraction has also been worked on and also there was progress made and it feels like everybody in the group is taking responsibility and work hard to move the project forwards. 

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)
Our biggest risk has and still is understanding and using AWS since this is still new to all of us. We feel like this is the biggest threat to the project, even though we also feel like we are getting more and more familiar with it. Apart from technical risks we haven't found any other new risks. 

### Iteration goals ###
Write feedback and send to other group, continue with AWS SAM reasearch, start with creation of state machine for backend. 


# Iteration 4 #

All numbered requirement IDs are from the backlog document found [here](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Product%20Backlog).

| Requirement | Task                  | State       | Estimated time |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 4 Documentation | Rework documentation from received feedback | Done | 6 * 5 h |
| 2 Backend   | Continue with AWS SAM setup and research | Done  |  10 * 5h | 
| - Meeting   | Meeting with university supervisor    | Done   | 0.5 * 2 h  |
| **Total actual time for iteration: 83.5 h** |

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 3 was a shorter iteration since there was Easter during the iteration. The group took a couple of days of both to focus on recovery and to focus on the other course where we write a thesis. During our working hours of last iteration we continued to work with the frontend a bit, but focus for most of the group members were to learn and use AWS SAM which is an architectural style for working with AWS. We split up our tasks for the backend so that everyone was responsible for a specific feature of the backend system. The iteration overall was good even though not as much time as the preceding iterations were devoted to the project. 

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)
We had some new risks in that not everyone would be able to run AWS SAM wince it required docker to work on the computer but this was taken care of and the risk were quickly dealt with. The group is working really well and our implementation is coming along great so currently we don't see any problems arising and therefore no new risks were identified. 

### Iteration goals ###
Rewrite the documentation according to feedback and continue with backend state machine development.


# Iteration 5 #

All numbered requirement IDs are from the backlog document found [here](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Product%20Backlog).

| Requirement | Task                  | State       | Estimated time |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| 2.2 State machine | Continue with aws state machine configuration and running | Done  | 35 h | 
| 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2 etc. | Continue with creation and configuration of lambda step functions that are going to be run in the state machine | Done s |  50 h |
| 5. Meeting   | Meeting with university supervisor    | Done | 5 h  |
| 3.2 Unit testing backend | Setup and running backend testing | Done  | 8 h |
| **Total actual time for iteration: 79 h** |

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 4 contained mostly work on the backend. We decided to leave the frontend for now since the backend and creating a working lambda step function state machine is more important at this moment. We created a milestone document that we will follow to make sure that we know what needs to be prioritized and that the customer can be sure that we do what they think is important as well. We re-wrote a lot of our documentation after we received feedback from our peers which also made it clearer what we need to work on. The iteration was good and we made good progress. 

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)
The new risks that we identified was that we could be prioritizing wrong and work on the wrong things that the customer didn't feel was necessary at this point. We decided to deal with this right away by creating a better backlog and a milestone document that we are awaiting approval from the customer on. 
 
### Iteration goals ###
Work on the backend with AWS state machine and lambda state functions. Start with the testing in a more direct way.

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 5 contained mostly work on the backend again. We work hard on our state machine and step-functions. We focus all of our time and attention there now since the client is working and from the customers side, the backend API is more important. The iteration was good and the whole group worked well.

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)

### Iteration goals ###
Getting feedback from customer to make sure that we prioritize correctly and that our milestones are correct. Hopefully finish the state machine to be able to test it out and start to get data on load etc that the customer wants.

| **Total actual time for iteration: 81 h** |

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Iteration 7 saw much time put into the state machine, as well as the heicToJPG lambda functions. The state machine and knowledge about it and how to use it was focused on a lot of progress was done here. HeicToJPG function was fixed and should now work as intended. We also put time into the companion server as well as some testing, but some of our members thought that a lot of time was wasted without any knowledge and progress was gained. Sebastian was sick the whole iteration. 

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)

### Iteration goals ###
This iteration will see a lot of testing, and the goals of the iteration is therefore to gain knowledge from testing that can be interesting for the customer. To get the companion server to actually work in production is also a goal.

### Analysis of last iteration ###
Last iteration we transfered our state machine and lambda functions to a new region to be able to run image rekognition. Emil finished the state machine with creating a finally function and set up support for websocket to be able to tell the client what is going on in the backend. The project is finally coming together and we start to feel that we are about to be done. It was a good week!

### New risks
All risks are listed [here.](https://bitbucket.org/infogrooup/file-uploading/wiki/Risker)

### Iteration goals ###
This is the last iteration and the project is almost done. We are focusing on finishing up, both the client and the statemachine is the backend will have some last minute work and then we are going to stresstest our system. We are going to finish up the documentation as well as creating the final report. We are also going to create a presentation for the final presentation.
