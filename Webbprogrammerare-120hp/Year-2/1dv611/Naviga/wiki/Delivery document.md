# Delivery to customer #

After discussion and agreement with the customer, the delivery will consist of a presentation at the customer company together with a findings document and the source code. 

The presentation will be held during week number 23 and will be a briefing and showcasing of how our system works, issues we have run into, pros and cons of our choose serverless architecture using AWS and other "findings" that we have came across during development. Since the customer is interested in evaluating our project in a way of "is this architecture a good way of handling image upload and processing" and will not take our source code and continue with it and implement it as is, a presentation of the system and our own thoughts were prioritized over anything else. The presentation will be complemented by our documentation regarding the system, how it works, what worked well and not and the things we have discovered during development.

Since the customer wanted a "proof of concept" there will most likely be no one else that will continue development of the project after we are finished and therefore not much time will be put into cleaning the code and writing instructions for coming developers, but instead the last few weeks, time will be put into testing the system and seeing what works well, what can be improved and other things that we can present as findings to the customer.
