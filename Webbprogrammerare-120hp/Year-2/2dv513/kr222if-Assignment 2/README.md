## About this assignment

Assignment 2 focuses on relational algebra and SQL.

For the SQL part, you will create a database to host data from Reddit. You can design the database however you like, with as few or as many tables you find necessary. Your main objective is to balance ease of implementation and performance; the database should perform as well as possible without sacrificing how understandable your design is.

You can use whatever relational database management system you prefer to solve the assignment. While it is technically not necessary to use any programming language, I recommend that you automate as much as you can, such as setting up tables, importing data, etc. You can use whatever programming language(s) you like for this task.

You are free to make additional assumptions, if you feel that some information is missing. Make sure to document all assumptions that you make.

All answers should be your own. You are allowed to work in groups of two. Make sure you include your names in the report when you submit.

Submit a report in PDF format on Moodle. You can draw the E/R diagrams by hand and submit scanned versions or photos (as long as they are readable). If you want to include source code, you can, but please submit those files together with the report in a zip archive. Do NOT submit any database dumps; these will be far too large for Moodle to handle
