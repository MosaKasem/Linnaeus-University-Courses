## About the program 120/180hp

This part of the assignment may be done in a group of one to four students. Every student must be active in the construction of the artifacts.

The basis for your testing assignment is the described scenario. Note that the requirements document provided does not contain the *only* requirements to be tested in this assignment, it contains the use cases for the abandonware but you also need to consider the scenario which provides stakeholders who has testing goals.

### Task 1
##### Scenario

```
The small Software Development Company (SDC) has found a possible market niche for giving out a simple to deploy web-server. 
SDC aims to redistribute this server on a wide range of Internet Of Things (IOT) to present information from sensors etc. 
SDC wants an easy to deploy java-web-server that can be deployed on many different devices and therefore that can attract attention of a wide range of IOT developers. 
IOT-developers want minimal configuration as well as easy integration and adaptation of the web-server. 
End-customers want easy access and absolute security. The SDC management has found an open source abandonware software called “My web server”. 
It is your job as SDC employee(s) to evaluate the current state of “My web server”. SDC needs to know if the abandoned 
software fulfills the requirements as stated in the requirement document. Your budget is one man-week times the number of students. 
SDC management want a strategy, plan, test-cases as well as a test-report.
```

### Task 2
Give constructive reviews on other Students Test-Strategies-Test-Plan, Test-Cases and Test-Reports using the peer-review system.
The feedback should be anonymous, no names or traces of who you are should be in them. It is however not anonymous to course management.
Be helpful and nice.

The more reviews of high quality you submit the higher the chance of getting a good grade, see grading. After the second task, the examiner will check reviews and may fail reviews that are considered not valid and truthful. This means that if your review is removed you might not get a grade unless you have submitted more reviews.

Review the Clarity

#### Review the ease of which the document can be read and understood.

    Language – Should be English. Issues can be related to Spelling or Grammar
    Format and layout – The document uses pdf. It uses Tables, Links, Titles of different levels when appropriate
    Disposition – The order of chapters or sections follow naturally so that they can be read from top to the bottom. The chapters are divided into paragraphs of text with a title.

#### Review the Completeness

Review that all parts of the document exists and that each part actually contains what it should

    Test Strategy
        Does the strategy describe stakeholders and their testing goals?
        Does the strategy describe the available resources?
        Does the strategy describe how the stakeholders testing goals are to be fulfilled by the plan?
    Test Plan – Should describe and outline the current iteration’s test effort(Who does what when).
        Does the test-plan describe what requirements that should be tested?
        Does the test-plan describe what requirements that should NOT be tested?
        Does the test-plan describe how testing should be done? at what test-level?
        Does the test-plan describe who should do different activities? (responsibilities)
    Manual Test Cases
        Are the manual test-cases traceable to which requirement that is tested?
        Do each manual test-case describe, input and expected output? (when relevant)
    Test Report
        Does the test-report show what has been tested and not tested?
        Does the test-report show which tests that fail or succeed?
        Is there testing the other group should have done?

#### Review the Content

Review the test effort by the other group. Has the other group done a good job reporting their testing of the product?

Ambition and test-effort

    Has the other group done a good job testing of the product, given the resources?
    Do the manual test-cases cover all relevant scenarios in the use-cases?
    Do the test-effort cover the relevant requirements?

Comment on what parts you think was good, what parts that could be improved and how to improve them:
