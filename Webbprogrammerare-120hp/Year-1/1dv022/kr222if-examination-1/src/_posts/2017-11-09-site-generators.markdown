# What do you think of static site generators?

It's like ordering Cheesecake at McDonald but you end up with half sliced riceburger.

It's a finished product, it works when it wants to, a bit annoying setting it up, and more annoying learning its basics, I wish this had value, like for instance Scss is completion to css, static site generators are not! this "MD" is same setup as html only you use special characters here instead of elements like `<h1>` you end up with having to use `#` which is unncessary, but I guess thats the whole point of using jekyll, fast food service.

* __What type of projects are they suitable for?__

I would have to go with blogging, but mind you, football fan blogg, maybe news blogg for a community/group or personal blogg, thats my personal opinion.
