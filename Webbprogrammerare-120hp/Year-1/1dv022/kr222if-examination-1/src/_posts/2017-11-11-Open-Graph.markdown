### What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?

Identify or a presentation of our page when someone shares it on other socialmedia, think of it as a small container that holds a small piece of information, i'd like to think of statue, usually they contain a title `(name of the statue)` and under it a small description `(information)` about the statue, except open grapgh are not statue, am only saying that as an example i hope you understand.
