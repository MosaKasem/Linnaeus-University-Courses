### What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

It's an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It's a TXT file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

**What to put in it**

You can mention the developer, the designer, the copywriter, the webmaster, the SEO, SEM or SMO...

This is an example:
{% highlight ruby %}

Your title: Your name.

                            
Site: email, link to a contact form, etc.

                            
Twitter: your Twitter username.   
#=> more can included more, this is just an example.
{% endhighlight %}
