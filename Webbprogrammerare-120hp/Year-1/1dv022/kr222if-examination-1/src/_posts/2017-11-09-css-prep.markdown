# What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

It's ok.
#### Questions
__1-Compare to regular css__


__2-Which techniques did you use?__


__3-Pros and cons?__

**1a.** Storing values in a variable that starts with the dollar sign, and you link those variables to multiple css codes of your choice, easier to maintain in the long run.

**2a.** border, background, color (may have changed some due to error), used @mixin and @include, and ofcourse storing values, and background in $variables, i hope that answers your question.

**3a.** __Cons__: More code. 
__pros:__ cleaner ui, coming from css, i found inlines to be much easier to understand, like this example `body {color: red;}` over `body color: red`
